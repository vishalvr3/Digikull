            I admire Jim Carrey for these reasons: he can be funnier than anyone
            I know.He can bring so much joy to people simply with a goofy smile.
            Doing a movie like ‚ÄúAce Ventura, Pet Detective‚Äù, ‚ÄúLiar Liar‚Äù,or ‚ÄúThe
            Grinch‚Äù, is like doing a good deed for the world. I can tell he‚Äôs
            very intellegent when it comes to acting. He's so full of life,
            never borring or lazy. He is truly a roll model for many people.

            Jim Carrey was born on January 17, 1962, in newmarket, Ontario,
            Canada. he lived in Aurora with his parents, two older sistrs, and
            brother. he was raised in many different towns in cannada. No matter
            what he always loved to make funny faces, except at school until he
            learned that they made him popular. when he was 13 years old his dad
            lost his job and money problems got big.
          </p>

          <p>
            At age 15 he got a spot for a stand up comedy club. it was a
            complete disaster. He was totally unprepared. For two years, he
            worked on his act. After two years, he auditioned and his
            performance was a success. He kept getting spots in comedy clubs and
            soon became popular as,‚ÄùThe Rubber face man‚Äù. He earned money to pay
            for a house and his parents moved in with him. He later moved to the
            united states and started on television shows. Years later, he made
            it to the movies.

            The way Jim Carrey makes you laugh. It‚Äôs something about his face,or
            voice, and especaily body movements. There‚Äôs no way not to laugh at
            his jokes and stuff. It‚Äôs like trying to put a lion in a cardboard
            box. My favorite movie of his are - ‚Äú<em
              >The Truman Show, Ace Ventura 2, The Three Stooges and
              Liar-Liar</em
            >‚Äù.
